        <h3>Shopper Focus</h3>
        <p>In 2020, with years of experience in building retail business intelligence solutions powered by AI-driven video analytics, SkyREC began to develop new digital initiatives that will enable retailers to take further actions on customer relationship management with real-time in-store insights.</p>
        <p>Shopper Focus is the customer-facing part of the retail CRM system that provides shoppers with a seamless offline-to-online customer loyalty programme experience. Given that building an app isn’t always the most affordable option for some mid-small size retailers, plus the in-store installation and registration process can be cumbersome at times, many merchants hesitate to launch their own digital customer loyalty programmes. After scouting the customer loyalty programme solutions around the market, SkyREC decided to take a different route and create a customisable CRM product that doesn’t require shoppers to download any single app.</p>
        <p>I joined this project after market research to initiate the product development process. I partnered up with the Head of R&D, Backend Team Lead, Frontend Developer, and Product Marketing to design and develop the MVP version of Shopper Focus and other parts of the retail CRM system.</p>

        <p>Cashier Focus is the handheld POS terminal part of the retail CRM system that enables retailers to carry out in-store customer loyalty programmes. With the aim to help cashiers navigate through the convoluted programmes at counters, we spoke to various types of part-time cashiers to understand the pain points and opportunities when it comes to delivering the right discounts, giveaways, and other perks. </p>
        <p>I partnered up with the Head of R&D, Backend Team Lead, Frontend Developer, and Product Marketing to design and develop the MVP version of Shopper Focus and other parts of the retail CRM system.</p>
        <p>The case study of cashier focus is still in construction. Stay tuned!</p>

        <p>In 2020, with years of experience in building retail business intelligence solutions powered by AI-driven video analytics, SkyREC began to develop new digital initiatives that enable retailers to take further actions on customer relationship management with real-time in-store insights.</p>
        <p>To help retailers manage the CRM system, Setting Panel streamlines the end-to-end workflows that enable all-level managers to set up customer loyalty programmes as well as store and inventory management on their own. Knowing that the corporate structure can be hierarchical in the retail business, we also took organisational communication into consideration and built a centralised access control feature to ensure the conditional settings from different levels of management won’t lead the customer loyalty programmes to override each other.</p>
        <p>I partnered up with the Head of R&D, Backend Team Lead, Frontend Developer, and Product Marketing to design and develop the MVP version of Setting Panel and other parts of the retail CRM system. I also worked with the Backend Team to clarify the cross-device data flow of the system and assist them in planning out the database schema by using the design of Setting Panel.</p>

        <h3>Between Two Lines</h3>
        <p>Between Two Lines is an informational website & knowledge base about unintended pregnancy for people in need, especially teenagers and young adults, to look up possible options and related knowledge. From April 2019 to May 2019, along with a series of social media campaigns and an interactive storytelling game, the website also served a quintessential role in this multifaceted project that tried to destigmatise the issue in Taiwan.</p>

        <p>Regarding the current sex education in Taiwan, we noticed that most textbooks only focus on the importance of contraception and fail to deliver the core knowledge about what happens after finding out about the pregnancy at a young age. As we understood that contraception is the premium key to avoiding all the upcoming troubles, there are still undeniably plenty of possibilities that might lead to these unintended results (eg. rape-pregnancy, failed-contraception). Ignoring these factors can put teenagers and young adult in perils when things actually take place unexpectedly. As a result, we decided to tackle this topic in our final year project and create a product that brings value to society.</p>

        <p>In this project, I was responsible for User Experience Design (UX), User Interface Design (UI),  Infographic Visualisation, Illustration and Usability Testing.</p>

        <h3>Cross-disciplinary Curriculum Platform</h3>
        <p>In 2017, National Chiao Tung University launched a new cross-disciplinary curriculum framework to encourage undergraduate students to claim a second profession through a series of new modular programmes conjoint by various faculty. Different from any other degree programmes, the new curriculum framework not only allowed students to explore their professional interests in cross-disciplinary learning; but also provided them with fewer timing constraints and greater flexibility to plan their timetables throughout the semester by breaking down the 18-week course structure into three 6-week modules with specific topics.</p>

    <p>However, with the structural changes brought by the cross-disciplinary curriculum framework, the original course management system didn’t have the affordance to tackle the new segmentation of curriculum structures and timeframes when it comes to module registration and management. To successfully roll out this project on time, the University decided to build a new system for the cross-disciplinary curriculum programme while adopting Moodle as the foundation for engineering development.</p>

    <p>As a contracted designer, I was tasked to create the search & module registration flow for the new module management system in collaboration with the contracted developer in 2 months. My responsibilities on this project comprised of three things:</p>

    <ol>
    <li>Defining the search & registration process</li>
    <li>Adapting the Moodle system </li>
    <li>Creating the UI patterns for the platform accordingly</li>
    </ol>

        <h3>Unintended Pregnancy Assistant App</h3>
        <p>Unintended Pregnancy Assistant App is a spin-off project of Between Two Lines. While taking User-centred Interaction Design (IOC5179) at National Chiao Tung University, the group and I decided to pick the same topic that we were working on as our final year project then, and explore further possibilities around the unintended pregnancy issue.</p>
        <p>In the original project, we built an informational platform that allows users to browse and learn important information and knowledge themselves. Whereas, in the spin-off project, we turned our solutions into mobile application form that collects fundamental information regarding the issue in the first place, tailors the services and allows users to contact the medics and counsellors and make an appointment directly via the app.</p>
        <p>I recrafted the app's user interface (UI) design in alignment with iOS human interface guidelines after finishing the project. During the project, we mainly focused on user research methods (interview, affinity diagram, personas, user flows and wireframing), lo-fi & high-fi prototyping, and usability testing to familiarise ourselves with the user-centred design process and better understand what users actually need.</p>
